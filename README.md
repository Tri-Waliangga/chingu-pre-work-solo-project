# chingu-pre-work-solo-project

## This is my first time on Chingu Voyage

This repo is solo-project from pre-work section before the voyage. I hope my solo-project met the requirements, so I can step up to the next stage (the Voyage).

### This is the requirement.

* You are not required to implement API's to obtain live data from Reddit, GitHub, or browser history.
* Use mocked text to fill in each of the components on the page, such as the Reddit news feed and the GITHUB ISSUE HISTORY sections. 
* The date and time in the center of the page should be correct for the users local time zone and should automatically refresh when the minute and the day advances.
* Implement every other section of the page except the advertisement panel in the lower right hand corner of the page.
* Create your own solution without looking at the page source for the site you are cloning.

*This requirements, I copy from Chingu handbook for solo-project Tier 1 Landing Page*
